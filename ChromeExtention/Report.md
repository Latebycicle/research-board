Issues to investigate:

- Removed redundant requests but now page data isn't being passed as an object in the console and doesn't show up in the memory snapshot. Suggest going back to the checkpoint and comparing changes. 
- Inspect local storage and ensure that the data is being saved to local storage
- "Remember this" doesn't seem to be storing anything
